# Analyzing 2023 AFCON Group Stages
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) group stages. Leveraging my skills in data analytics and utilizing tools such as Python, I systematically processed and analyzed data from the tournament. The project involved tasks such as predicting match outcomes, updating group stage tables based on match results, and deriving insights into team performances.

I applied statistical methods to predict future points for each team, incorporating factors such as historical performance and current tournament dynamics. This predictive model enabled the simulation of match scenarios and their impact on team standings. Through efficient data preprocessing and cleansing, I ensured the accuracy and reliability of the analytical results.

Furthermore, I utilized pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, to update and organize group stage tables dynamically. This involved calculating and allocating points to teams based on match outcomes, considering the nuances of the AFCON point system.

The project not only demonstrated my proficiency in data analytics and programming but also showcased my ability to derive meaningful insights from sports data. The analyses conducted provided a valuable understanding of team dynamics, facilitating predictions and discussions about potential tournament outcomes.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in handling real-world sports data, making data-driven predictions, and presenting insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the 2023 AFCON group stages.
